## Usage

### Install

```bash
yarn add @resistdesign/voltra
```

### Imports

Prefer the public entrypoints below to keep imports stable and IDE auto-imports clean.

Preferred:

```ts
import {IaC} from "@resistdesign/voltra";
import {Packs} from "@resistdesign/voltra/iac";
import {addDNS} from "@resistdesign/voltra/iac/packs";
```

Not supported:

```ts
import addDNS from "@resistdesign/voltra/iac/packs/dns";
```

Public entrypoints:

- `@resistdesign/voltra`
- `@resistdesign/voltra/api`
- `@resistdesign/voltra/app`
- `@resistdesign/voltra/common`
- `@resistdesign/voltra/iac`
- `@resistdesign/voltra/iac/packs`

## Build-time Type Parsing (Advanced)

Voltra exposes TypeScript compiler–powered parsing utilities intended **only for build-time tooling** (scripts,
generators, CI).

These APIs depend on the TypeScript compiler and **must not be imported into runtime code** (e.g. Lambdas, servers,
browsers).

Build entrypoint:

```ts
import {getTypeInfoMapFromTypeScript} from "@resistdesign/voltra/build";
```

Use this entrypoint for:

- Code generation
- Pre-build analysis
- Producing static artifacts (JSON / TS)

Do **not** import `@resistdesign/voltra/build` from runtime code.

## With our powers combined!

<td>Voltra is a state-of-the-art platform designed to streamline the creation of cloud infrastructure and complex web
applications. It features a robust API with RPC, CORS, and versatile authentication options, alongside dynamic app
development tools like TypeScript-driven form generation. The platform excels in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), offering
features like chainable stacks and comprehensive parameter support. Its intuitive interface simplifies the addition of
databases, storage, authentication, and functions through easy-to-use packs. Furthermore, Voltra enhances development
workflows with advanced state management, and a smart, lightweight routing system for React
front-end apps.</td>

## Docs Site

The docs site is both reference documentation and a canonical usage example.
Key pieces:

- Astro app in `site/app` builds the UI into `site-dist/app` via `yarn site:build:app`.
- API bundle for the docs site is built by `yarn site:build:api` (see `site/build-api.mjs`) and written to
  `site-dist/api`.
- The IaC demo template is generated by `yarn site:build:iac` from `site/iac/index.ts` and written to
  `site-dist/iac/index.yml`.

API docs flow:

1) `yarn doc` generates TypeDoc output into `docs/`.
2) `yarn doc-to-site` copies `docs/` into `site-dist/app/`.
3) `yarn site:build:app` runs Astro and then `yarn finalize-site` to refresh the docs site with API docs.

## IaC Type Generation

IaC types are generated from the AWS CloudFormation resource specification.
When updating, follow this flow:

1) Download the latest CloudFormation resource specification JSON from AWS (region: `us-east-1`).
2) Replace the contents of `src/iac/types/CloudFormationResourceSpecification.ts` with the JSON payload (as the exported
   data).
3) Run `yarn iac:types:gen` to regenerate `dist/IaCTypes.ts`.
4) Verify `dist/IaCTypes.ts` looks correct, then commit both files.

Notes:

- `src/iac/types/IaCTypes.ts` and `src/iac/types/CloudFormationResourceSpecification.ts` are generated artifacts; do not
  edit by hand.
- The generator entrypoint is `src/iac/types/generate.ts` and uses `src/iac/types/Renderers.ts` for output.

## Releasing

Voltra publishes npm packages from GitHub Releases. The release tag is used verbatim
as the npm package version, so it must be valid SemVer without a leading `v`.

### Stable releases

Use tags like:

```
3.0.0
```

### Pre-releases (alpha, beta, rc)

Use tags like:

```
3.0.0-alpha.0
3.0.0-beta.1
3.0.0-rc.1
```

When the GitHub Release is marked as a prerelease, the npm publish step uses the
`next` dist-tag instead of `latest`. Consumers can install prereleases with:

```bash
yarn add @resistdesign/voltra@next
```

## Project

### Build and test commands

```bash
yarn build
yarn test
yarn test:gen
yarn doc
yarn start
yarn site:build:app
```

### Contribution guidelines

- Use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `doc:`, `chore:`) with optional scopes.
- Keep subjects imperative and concise.
- Include test commands run (or reasons for skipping) in PR descriptions.
